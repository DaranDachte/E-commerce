 Hello. My name is Daran Dahte. I live in West Germany, in the DÃ¼sseldorf area and do Web Development. In my work I use
-HTML,
-CSS,
-Java Script,
-React,
-Typescript...
In this project, I decided to study how the Mantin UI framework works and create an E-Commerce website using it. I liked the Mantin and I hope to do another project with it to consolidate the knowledge gained. https://mantine.dev/

I also used the site https://dummyjson.com/ to send requests and get the data necessary for work.

I took the icons from the tabler-icons-react library at https://tabler-icons-react.vercel.app/

I found the illustrations on the site https://undraw.co/

I created my logo using the site https://logo.com/

The favicon was created using https://favicon.io/

I sent the completed form to https://formsubmit.co/

Photos were taken from several free resources.
