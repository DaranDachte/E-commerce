Hello. My name is Daran Daсhte. I live in West Germany, in the Düsseldorf area and do Web Development. In my work I use:
<ul>
 <li>-HTML</li>
 <li>-CSS</li>
 <li>-Java Script</li>
 <li>-React</li>

 </ul>

In this project, I decided to study how the <b>Mantine UI</b> framework works and created an E-Commerce website using it. I liked the Mantine and I hope to do another project with it to consolidate the knowledge gained.  https://mantine.dev/ [](http://a.com)

I also used the website https://dummyjson.com/ to send requests and get the data necessary for work.

I took the icons from the tabler-icons-react library at https://tabler-icons.io/

I found the illustrations on the website https://undraw.co/

I created my logo using the website https://logo.com/

The favicon was created using https://favicon.io/

I sent the completed form to https://formsubmit.co/

Photos were taken from several free resources.
